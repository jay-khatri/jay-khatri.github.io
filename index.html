      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        In school, I had interests in hardware/software co-design, software
        architecture and robotics. After taking a few jobs throughout college, I
        developed a deep interest in web infrastructure and developing the
        future of the internet.
      </p>
      <h2>Past</h2>
      <p>
        Most recently, I went through <a href="ycombinator.com">YCombinator (S20)</a> with a company called 
        <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/reploy">Reploy</a>, 
        where I built/designed the product and drove sales. At its core, Reploy
        used <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes</a> to schedule
        ephemeral environments.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before that, I spent time working on product at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://joinhandshake.com">Handshake</a>,
        anti-abuse infrastructure at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com">Google</a>, and most
        recently on machine learning infra at
        <a target="_blank" href="deepmind.com">Deepmind</a>. In high school, I
        was a captain of the 2015 FTC World Championship
