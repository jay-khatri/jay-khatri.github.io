    Hi, I'm Jay ðŸ‘‹. I'm an engineer and product designer. I'm the former ceo and
    co-founder of <a href="https://getreploy.com">Reploy</a> (YC S20).

    <br />
    <br />

    > Interests
    <br />
    <br />
    In school, I had interests in hardware/software co-design, software
    architecture and robotics. After taking a few jobs throughout college, I
    developed a deep interest in web infrastructure and developing the future of
    the internet.

    <br />
    <br />
    > Past
    <br />
    <br />
    Most recently, I worked on <a href="https://getreploy.com">Reploy</a> (<a
      href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/reploy"
      >product hunt</a
    >, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23917956">hn</a>), where I
    built/designed the product and drove sales from 0 -> $3k MRR in 3 weeks. At
    its core, Reploy used <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes</a> to
    schedule ephemeral environments. In the recent past, I've spent time working
    on product at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://joinhandshake.com">Handshake</a>,
    anti-abuse infrastructure at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com">Google</a>, and most
    recently on machine learning infra at
    <a target="_blank" href="deepmind.com">Deepmind</a>. In high school, I was a
    captain of the 2015 FTC World Championship
