  Hi, I'm Jay 👋. I'm an engineer, product designer and entrepreneur. I'm the former CEO of <a href="https://getreploy.com">Reploy</a> and I'm now working on something new ⚙️.

> Interests
  <br>
In school, I had interests in hardware/software co-design, software architecture and robotics. My personal projects reflected this. After taking a few jobs throughout college, I developed a deep interest/understanding of web infrastructure.
