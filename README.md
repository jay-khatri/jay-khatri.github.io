## Available Scripts

If you have any interest in running this locally (for some weird reason), here's how:

### `yarn`
This installs packages in `package.json`.

### `yarn start`
This'll build the js bundle and serve it on a local port.

### `yarn deploy`
This'll build the js bundle and creat new hashes for all static files.
