This is Jay's personal website. Good morning.

## Available Scripts

If you have any interest in running this locally (for some weird reason), here's how:

### `yarn`
This installs packages in `package.json`.

### `yarn start`
This'll build the js bundle and serve it on a local port.

### `yarn build && git add/commit/push`
This'll build the js bundle and creat new hashes for all static files. Then just upload to github :).
