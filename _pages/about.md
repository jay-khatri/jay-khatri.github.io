title: "About Me"
---

Hi, I'm Jay. Thanks for visiting my site ðŸ˜€. I'm a student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://tamu.edu). 
### Interests
 I have interests in hardware and software co-design, software architecture and robotics. I like to say that I have a pretty unique background, which is well reflected in my projects.
 
### Past
In high school, I was a captain of the [2015 FTC World Championship Robotics team](https://www.theledger.com/article/LK/20140313/News/608076751/LL/), and at the time, I had a strong focus in mechanical design and electronics. Since then, I've taken an interest in software engineering, having done a few interships ranging from full stack development to web infrastructure. In my coursework, I especially enjoy classes related hw/sw co-design, algorithms and operating systems.

### Recent Experience
At recent jobs, I've especially enjoyed working on small teams and being able to contribute product decisions as an engineer. I've had recent internships at [Handshake](http://joinhandshake.com), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/).
