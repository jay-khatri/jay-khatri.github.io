title: "About Me"
---

Hi, I'm Jay. Thanks for visiting my site ðŸ˜€. I'm a student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. 
### Interests
 I have interests in hardware and software co-design, software architecture and robotics. I like to say that I have a pretty unique background, which is well reflected in my projects.
 
### Past
In high school, I was a captain of the 2015 FTC World Championship Robotics team, and at the time, I had a strong focus in mechanical design and electronics. Since then, I've taken an interest in software engineering, having done a few interships ranging from full stack development to web infrastructure. In my coursework, I especially enjoy classes related hw/sw co-design, algorithms and operating systems.

### Recent
Based on past experience, I've really enjoyed working on small teams and having the ability to contribute product 
decisions as an engineer. I'll upload my internship shortly.
